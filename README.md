# Creating a .NET MAUI Column Chart to Visualize which Plant Milk is the Most Sustainable.

Column charts are useful for displaying changes in data over a specific period of time or for illustrating comparisons between different items.

## Customization:
The appearance of the column chart can be customized using properties such as Fill, PaletteBrushes, CornerRadius, Stroke, and StrokeWidth.

## Plot area background view:
Any view can be added to the plot area using the PlotAreaBackgroundView support, which is useful for adding relevant data.

In this example, we will explore the details of the most sustainable milk using the .NET MAUI Cartesian Chart.

Various plant-based milks, including soy, rice, oat, and almond, are now widely accessible, no longer confined to specialty stores. Many are making the switch from dairy to these alternatives due to concerns about animal welfare and climate. But which is the most environmentally friendly? And how do they compare nutritionally to dairy milk? The consensus is that non-dairy milks generally surpass cowâ€™s milk in terms of carbon emissions, land use, and water consumption.



## Troubleshooting:
### Path too long exception:
If you encounter a path too long exception when building this example project, close Visual Studio and rename the repository to a shorter name before building the project.
